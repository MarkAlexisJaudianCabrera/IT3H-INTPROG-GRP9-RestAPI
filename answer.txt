Based on my understanding that the rest api which we can use to interact within a database but it also has a set of rules 
for the development of webservices that we can do. As on the article that I read about Rest APIs that in can call data 
that we can access and manipulate the data also that pertains into my understanding that the Rest API is usually used in 
JSON to format the data that is sent and received to the server and we can mostly also see it in some forms in websites. 
Relating into a JSON it is just a simple data format that is used in the universal language for computers, it is also a 
type of structure data that can be read by a human being and machine languages ​​especially computers. Mostly in the simple 
placement of curly braces on objects or square brackets on the arrays are one of the use of JSON. In my understanding 
of an http post which is similar to on a writing a letter and sending it to a server in which let's also say that we want to 
send data to a server, we can use the post methods where the all the data that can come from the submitted form and process 
all of this data that can store, update, perform, or what action can we do towards the database. When i tried the given link 
on GCR I tried the social media platform which is the facebook.com and press the send button after pressing the send button 
I saw that the contents, headers, and the raw materials that are used in a html format was shown because of the API tool 
since the security of the social media platforms especially for the facebook was very highly secured the html format that 
are returned shows some errors which I also understand because it is normal to have these errors due to highly secured 
websites or platforms.
